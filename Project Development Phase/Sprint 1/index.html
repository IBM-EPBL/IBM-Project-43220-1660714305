      Eyelids are the outermost protective parts of the eye. They act as ‘shutters’ and primary barriers against external environment. Boundaries of eyelids are covered by tiny hairline termed as eyelashes.As we go past eyelids, the next component is
      the circular frontage of the spherical eyeball, termed as cornea. Cornea is the first optical component of the eye machinery, dealing first-hand with the incoming light. Its function is of a primary filter, before passing on the light to the
      lens and retina.

      Early diabetic retinopathy. In this more common form — called nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) — new blood vessels aren't growing (proliferating).When you have NPDR, the walls of the blood vessels in your retina weaken. Tiny bulges
      protrude from the walls of the smaller vessels, sometimes leaking fluid and blood into the retina. Larger retinal vessels can begin to dilate and become irregular in diameter as well. NPDR can progress from mild to severe as more blood vessels
      become blocked.
